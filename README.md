# simple-bookShop-27-11.22

simple book shop, connected to mysql database with simple backend.
You can add books, delete and update them. When you dd a book, you have to fill out the form with title,
description, price and cover picture. It is stored in database.

Tech stack used: JS, React, mysql, react router dom, express.js

On the positive style:
Crud operations works fine,
i think code is pretty clear and easy to read and understand.
not large ammounts of code in one file.
On the negative side:

styling. Its not my strongest side, but it doesnt matter in this case so much. 
Main goal was to practise some react routines and frontend - backend connection. 

There are features i want to upgrade in the future:
  1.  display one book view in react, I started to write it ,but running out of ideas how to do it right now.. need a hint...
  2. could be nice to create a login page, where only admin can add, change books etc..
  3. do more styling
  
  4* rewrite into typescript
  5* rewrite mysql to mongo..
